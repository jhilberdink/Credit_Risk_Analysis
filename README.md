# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

This project compares the effectiveness of different machine learning models at predicting credit card risk. Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, I first tested several over- and undersampling algorithms and then tested the results with a Logistic Regression.  I concluded the analysis by testing the Balanced Random Forest Classifier and Easy Ensemble Classifier machine learning models.

## Results

#### Over- and Undersampling Methods

- The Naive Random Oversampling algorithm produced a balanced accuracy score of 0.65, a precision score of 0.01, and recall score of 0.69.
- SMOTE Oversampling produced a balanced accuracy score of 0.66, a precision of 0.01, and a recall of 0.63.
- Undersampling the data with the Cluster Centroids algorithm produced a balanced accuracy score of 0.54, a precision of 0.01, and a recall of 0.69.
- The SMOTEENN combination over- and undersampling algorithm produced a balanced accuracy score of of 0.66, a precision of 0.01, and a recall of of 0.75.
